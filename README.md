# ðŸ‘¤ .dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository. Anything that I might find useful to save or share it will be here. 

Customizations like Bash aliases, shortcuts, paths or other things will also be here in some sort of organized structure.

## ðŸ“¦ Files 

### .bashrc

This is the main Bash profile. It will load any other files and custom aliases.
